  ## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three functions first one demonstrates the use of a required keyword, the second one demonstrates the use of the revert keyword and the third one shows the use of assert. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
